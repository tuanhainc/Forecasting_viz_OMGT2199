# Forecasting_viz_OMGT2199
## Henry Baking Company's case study
This is a school assignment that required me to present the daily forecast for the whole week 5 of the company HBC. To support the visualization, I used ggplot2 in Posit Cloud with the aim to more easily compare different forecasting techniques with the original actual demand. The purpose is to illustrate the accuracy, pros, and cons of each technique.
